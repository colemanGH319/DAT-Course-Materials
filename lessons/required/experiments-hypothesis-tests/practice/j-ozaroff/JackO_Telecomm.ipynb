    "You work for a telecommunications company. The company has been storing metadata about customer phone usage, as part of the regular course of business. Currently, this data is sitting in an unsecured database. The company doesn't want to pay to increase their database security, because they don't think there's really anything to be learned from the metadata.\n",
