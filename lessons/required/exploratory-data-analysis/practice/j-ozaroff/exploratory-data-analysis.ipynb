    "## What Is Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective:** Define what Pandas is and how it relates to data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a Python library that primarily adds two new datatypes to Python: `DataFrame` and `Series`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `Series` is a sequence of items, where each item has a unique label (called an `index`).\n",
    "- A `DataFrame` is a table of data. Each row has a unique label (the `row index`), and each column has a unique label (the `column index`).\n",
    "- Note that each column in a `DataFrame` can be considered a `Series` (`Series` index).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Behind the scenes, these datatypes use the NumPy (\"Numerical Python\") library. NumPy primarily adds the `ndarray` (n-dimensional array) datatype to Pandas. An `ndarray` is similar to a Python list — it stores ordered data. However, it differs in three respects:\n",
    "> - Each element has the same datatype (typically fixed-size, e.g., a 32-bit integer).\n",
    "> - Elements are stored contiguously (immediately after each other) in memory for fast retrieval.\n",
    "> - The total size of an `ndarray` is fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Storing `Series` and `DataFrame` data in `ndarray`s makes Pandas faster and uses less memory than standard Python datatypes. Many libraries (such as scikit-learn) accept `ndarray`s as input rather than Pandas datatypes, so we will frequently convert between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is frequently used in data science because it offers a large set of commonly used functions, is relatively fast, and has a large community. Because many data science libraries also use NumPy to manipulate data, you can easily transfer data between libraries (as we will often do in this class!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a large library that typically takes a lot of practice to learn. It heavily overrides Python operators, resulting in odd-looking syntax. For example, given a `DataFrame` called `cars` which contains a column `mpg`, we might want to view all cars with mpg over 35. To do this, we might write: `cars[cars['mpg'] > 35]`. In standard Python, this would most likely give a syntax error. (**Challenge:** Using only built-in datatypes, can you define `cars` and `mpg` to make this expression valid?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas also highly favors certain patterns of use. For example, looping through a `DataFrame` row by row is highly discouraged. Instead, Pandas favors using **vectorized functions** that operate column by column. (This is because each column is stored separately as an `ndarray`, and NumPy is optimized for operating on `ndarray`s.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not be discouraged if Pandas feels overwhelming. Gradually, as you use it, you will become familiar with which methods to use and the \"Pandas way\" of thinking about and manipulating data."

    "### Class Methods and Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas `DataFrame`s are Pandas class objects and therefore come with attributes and methods. To access these, follow the variable name with a dot. For example, given a `DataFrame` called `users`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- users.index       # accesses the `index` attribute -- note there are no parentheses. attributes are not callable\n",
    "- users.head()      # calls the `head` method (since there are open/closed parentheses)\n",
    "- users.head(10)    # calls the `head` method with parameter `10`, indicating the first 10 rows. this is the same as:\n",
    "- users.head(n=10)  # calls the `head` method, setting the named parameter `n` to have a value of `10`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the `head` method accepts one parameter with an optional name of `n` because it is in the documentation for that method. Let's see how to view the documentation next."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Viewing Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to find more information about a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 1:** In Jupyter, you can quickly view documentation for a method by following the method name by a `?`, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "users.head?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "Signature: users.head(n=5)\n",
    "Docstring: Returns first n rows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we would normally invoke this method by calling `users.head(5)`. One quirk of IPython is that the `?` symbol must be the last character in the cell. Otherwise, it might not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The `?` is a shortcut for the built-in Python function `help`, which returns the method's docstring. For example:\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "help(users.head)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 2:** You can also search online for the phrase \"`DataFrame head`\", since you are calling the method `head` on the `users` object, which happens to be a `DataFrame`. (`type(users) => pandas.DataFrame`)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can alternatively search online for `pandas head`, but be careful! `DataFrame` and `Series` both have a `head` method, so make sure you view the documentation for the correct one since they might be called differently. You will know you are looking at the correct documentation page because it will say `DataFrame.head` at the top, instead of `Series.head`."
