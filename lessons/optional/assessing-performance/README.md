## Materials We Provide

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lesson | Assessing Performance Lesson | [Here](./assessing-performance-lesson.ipynb) |
| Solution  | Solution code for Lesson Prompts | [Here](./assessing-performance-lesson-solutions.ipynb) |
| Datasets | Titanic Survival (CSV): Passenger/survival info. | [Here](./data/titanic.csv) |
| Practice |  | [Here](./) |

> The Titanic survival dataset was chosen for this lesson because it is interesting, easy to understand, and commonly used in other tutorials. This dataset is also used in an official Kaggle tutorial (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which might be useful for students who want to explore Kaggle or the dataset further.
