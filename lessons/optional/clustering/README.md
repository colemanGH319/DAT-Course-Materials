## Materials We Provide

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lesson | Clustering | [Here](./clustering_lesson.ipynb) |
| Datasets | Beer nutrition and cost | [Here](./data/beer.txt) |
| Extra Practice | Four additional labs for practice | [Here](./practice/) |

> This lesson uses a small beer dataset describing beer name, calories, sodium content, alcohol percentage, and cost. This data set is ideal because it is easy to read it all and clusters into identifiable categories.

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to:

- Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Format and preprocess data for clustering
- Understand and know how to apply k-means clustering.
- Understand and know how to apply density-based clustering (DBSCAN).
- Define Inertia and Silhouette score and how they relate to clustering.
- Evaluate clusters for fit

---

## Student Requirements

Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:
- Define basic principles of supervised learning.
- Intuit relevant information from k-NN and Voronoi diagrams.
- Prepare features and create models using scikit-learn.
- Graph data using Matplotlib.
