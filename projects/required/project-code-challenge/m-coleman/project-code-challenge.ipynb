    "#### The logic for the above solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First we need a helper function that tests whether or not an integer is a palindrome. To the best of my knowledge, an integer needs to be converted to a string in order to conduct this test. The helper function tests whether the first and last characters of the string are equivalent and returns 'False' if not; otherwise the function will slice off the first and last characters and make a recursive call of itself on the remaining substring until there are no characters left to test, in which case 'True' is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once the function is working, we can create an array of all products of two 3-digit numbers by looping over all integers from 999 to 100 in two separate variables, calculating their products and appending those results to the array. Note that in the above loop we avoid calculating any of the products twice, because 923 * 765 == 765 * 923.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The next line is calling two functions: map, which converts the array 'products' from integers to strings; and filter, which takes that converted list and returns only the items that pass the palindrome test.\n",
